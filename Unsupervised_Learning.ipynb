        "# Question1: What is Dimensionality Reduction? Why is it important in Machine Learning?\n",
        " -   Dimensionality Reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of input features in a dataset while keeping the important information intact. When a dataset has too many features, it becomes difficult for models to learn correctly and processing also becomes slow. High dimensions can create noise, duplicate information, and confusion for algorithms. By reducing dimensions, the data becomes cleaner, simpler, and easier to visualize. It also helps in improving model accuracy by removing irrelevant features. Many ML models work better and faster when only the most meaningful features are used. Therefore, Dimensionality Reduction is an important step to make machine learning models efficient, accurate, and easy to interpret."

        " -  Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique where data points are grouped based on their similarity without using any predefined labels. The goal is to place similar items in the same group and keep dissimilar items in different groups. It helps in understanding patterns, structures, and hidden relationships in data. Clustering is widely used in customer segmentation, image grouping, and anomaly detection. Three popular clustering algorithms are K-Means, which divides data into fixed clusters, Hierarchical Clustering, which creates a tree-like structure of clusters, and DBSCAN, which forms clusters based on density and identifies noise separately."

It helps in detecting rare activities that may indicate problems, risks, or important discoveries. Anomaly detection is widely used in fraud detection, network security, system monitoring, and quality control. It highlights unexpected behavior that normal models might ignore. By spotting these irregular patterns early, businesses and systems can prevent major issues and improve reliability. Thus, anomaly detection plays a crucial role in maintaining safety, accuracy, and performance in real-world applications."

        " -  Time series analysis is a method used to study data points collected over regular time intervals to understand trends, patterns, and future behavior. It helps in predicting how a variable will change over time based on previous observations. Time series data is common in fields like finance, weather forecasting, sales prediction, and sensor monitoring. Two important components of time series data are Trend, which shows the long-term increasing or decreasing movement, and Seasonality, which represents repeating patterns that occur at fixed intervals (like daily, monthly, or yearly). Together, these components help analysts understand how data behaves over time and make accurate forecasts."

        " -  Seasonality refers to patterns in a time series that repeat at fixed and predictable intervals, such as every day, month, or year. These patterns are usually driven by factors like weather changes, festivals, or business cycles that occur regularly. On the other hand, cyclic behavior represents long-term ups and downs that do not follow a fixed or regular schedule. Cycles are often influenced by economic conditions or market trends and can last for months or years. The key difference is that seasonality is predictable and time-bound, while cycles are irregular and harder to forecast. Both patterns help in understanding and modeling the behavior of time-based data."

        "# Question 9: What is inheritance in OOP? Provide a simple example in Python.\n",
        "  -  Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a mechanism where one class (child class) can use the properties and methods of another class (parent class). It helps in reusing code, reducing repetition, and organizing programs in a clean structure. The child class can extend or modify the parent’s behavior without rewriting everything. Inheritance is useful for creating logical relationships between classes and making code easier to maintain."

        "# Question 10: How can time series analysis be used for anomaly detection?\n",
        "  -  Time series analysis helps detect anomalies by monitoring how data behaves over time and identifying points that break the regular pattern. Models first learn the normal trend, seasonality, and expected variations in the time-based data. When a new data point suddenly moves too high, too low, or behaves differently from the learned pattern, it is flagged as an anomaly. Techniques like moving averages, ARIMA, and LSTM predict the expected value and compare it with the actual value. Large deviations indicate unusual behavior. This method is widely used in fraud detection, server monitoring, stock analysis, and detecting faults in machines."
